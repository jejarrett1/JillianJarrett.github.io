          <p>The days of paper crammed briefcases and portfolios are over. We are living in a technology driven world where all of our assets
            proffessional assests are living in digital form . Those assets are either scattered around your computer, cloud storage, or like most of us both.
            Collected was an exploration done into designing a product that could potentially break into the cloud storage and
            organization market while leveraging social media/sharing. Collect your digital assets and optimize your work flow. </p>

            <p>Assuming the role of lead designer I conducted user research and surveying to identify pitfalls in current cloud storage designs.
              I drew from surveying that users were having trouble staying organized.  It also became evident that people have assets scattered
              across multiple cloud storage platforms. Armed with this knowledge, I decided to focus the direction of the product on designing a place</p>

                  <p class="mx-auto">User testing uncovered structural flaws that I had not seen. Better labeling was needed to pages and components; areas made sense to myself as the designer but the user was clueless to the purpose. Navigation also needed improving. It was clear something was causing confusion for the user.  After adjusting, I was hopeful a second round of testing would have better resutls. Although the second round of test showed great improvement s in usability, there was still confusion present. Finally, I realized that the source of confusion was related to the number of options and information the user is presented with. Limiting both of these would improve usability. </p>

                    <p>In user testing, it became evident that the prototypes were too tailored.
                      I initially designed the prototype as if it were an account of my own;
                      it caused confusion for all users. I was overly concerned
                      in testing that users could complete a task that I didn't test if the neccessaty of features.
                      In the last iteration, I ended up removing two features.</p>
