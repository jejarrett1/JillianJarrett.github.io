      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>The days of paper crammed briefcases and portfolios are over. We are living in a technology driven world where all of our assets
        proffessional assests are living in digital form . Those assets are either scattered around your computer, cloud storage, or like most of us both.
        Collected was an exploration done into designing a product that could potentially break into the cloud storage and
        organization market while leveraging social media/sharing. Collect your digital assets and optimize your work flow. </p>

        <h1> The Problem</h1>
        <p>There is no leader in a business solution to cloud storage. Many of the top competitors in the cloud space are still vying to grasp this part of the market. Strategically, I decided to focus on designing a product where users could share and market professional digital assets with other users.</p>

          <h1>User Surveying</h1>
          <p>Assuming the role of lead designer I conducted user research and surveying to identify pitfalls in current cloud storage designs.
            I drew from surveying that users were having trouble staying organized.  It also became evident that people have assets scattered
            across multiple cloud storage platforms. Armed with this knowledge, I decided to focus the direction of the product on designing a place</p>

            <h1>User Flows</h1>
            <p>At this point I developed user flows for an application to help solve the current frustrations of my target audience.  
              Upon signing in a user would be directed to the user landing page. From here the user enters a Workspace,
              a place for building collaborative teams and projects. In Workspaces, files can either be linked or uploaded into databases, or Collections.  </p>

              <h1>The Collected User</h1>
              <p>I devolped personas of my target user. Amma Zurich was one of them. A senior graphic designer from Atlanta, Georgia, Amma is currently storing finished designs, in-progress designs, inspirational images, among other documents in the cloud.  She works with a team; when one file is passed to another designer, member notes are essential for clueing in the new designer where the other left off.  It is also imperative for her to keep track of who is tasked with what during the design process. </p>

            <h1>Branding</h1>
            <p>In branding I focused on creating a brand that would appeal to the likes and priorities of millennials. They are soon to be the largest generation active in the business world. I wanted to invoke fun and trustworthy emotions from users. The user should feel clear and organized when using the product. </p>

            <h1>Sketching and Wireframing</h1>
            <p>I sketched possible layouts for my product, focusing on use of sharp geometric objects
              to make the user feel clear and organized. I refined my sketches into wireframes.
              I needed real user feedback on the product thus far so I went directly into round one of user testing.</p>

              <h1>Testing</h1>
              <p>User testing uncovered structural flaws that I had not seen. Better labeling was needed to pages and components; areas made sense to myself as the designer but the user was clueless to the purpose. Navigation also needed improving. It was clear something was causing confusion for the user.  After adjusting, I was hopeful a second round of testing would have better resutls. Although the second round of test showed great improvement s in usability, there was still confusion present. Finally, I realized that the source of confusion was related to the number of options and information the user is presented with. Limiting both of these would improve usability. </p>

              <h1>Conclusion</h1>
              <p>In user testing, it became evident that the prototypes were too tailored.
                I initially designed the prototype as if it were an account of my own;
                it caused confusion for all users. I was overly concerned
                in testing that users could complete a task that I didn't test if the neccessaty of features.
                In the last iteration, I ended up removing two features.</p>
